# DrugConsumption
Analysis of drug consumption in python

Our dataset is about drug consumption. It contains records for 1885 respondants for which 12 attributes are known. Addition to this we have their consumption for 18 legal and illegal drugs.

We want to be able to predict whether the person is a user or not of a chosen drug.

To do so, we performed some machine learning algorithms.

Finally, in the 'predict drugs' file, you can find everything you need to run the Flask application that helps predict the drug consumption for a new person. Before running it using 'localhost:5000' on your browser, make sure you are running the file 'app.py'.
